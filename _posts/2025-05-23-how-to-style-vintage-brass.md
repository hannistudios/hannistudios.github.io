# How to Style Vintage Brass

Vintage brass is one of my favorite ways to add warmth and character to any room. It's timeless, a little bit glam, and totally versatile. Here are a few ways I like to style brass in my own space:

---

### 1. Layered Brass Candlesticks

Group mismatched candlesticks together on a mantle or sideboard. Look for different heights and patinas â€” the more worn, the better! I love pairing them with hand-dipped taper candles in moody tones like rust or forest green.

---

### 2. Brass Frames

Framing a photo or artwork in a brass picture frame immediately elevates it. I find so many secondhand frames in various sizes â€” they make the perfect addition to a gallery wall.

### 3. Brass + Botanicals

Brass and greenery are a match made in heaven. Try styling small brass planters with trailing vines, or use a brass tray to hold freshly cut fern leaves. The contrast of soft green with golden metal just works.

### 4. Shelf Styling with Brass Accents

Mix in small brass objects â€” animals, bowls, vases (the quirkier the better!) â€” alongside books and ceramics. They add a pop of shine and make your shelf look collected, not cluttered.

---

### 5. Vintage Brass Finishes

Even if you have a new home, you can incorporate vintage brass finishes. I am always finding brass door knobs, hinges, drawer pulls, and even vent covers that would make such lovely details in a new home. This is an amazing way to add character to an otherwise plain canvas.

### Tip: Embrace the Imperfections

I love letting brass age naturally. Polished brass is beautiful, but so is the slightly tarnished look. A little patina tells a story â€” I rarely clean my pieces unless I want a real shine.

âœ¨ Whether you're a maximalist or minimalist, brass fits in beautifully. Start small, stay curious, and let your home evolve with the treasures you find.
