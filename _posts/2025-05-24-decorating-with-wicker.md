# Decorating With Wicker
---
If you're looking to add texture, warmth, and function to your space, wicker is the secret weapon you didn’t know you needed. Here are six cozy and creative ways to decorate with wicker:

###1. Wall Baskets
Create instant character by grouping flat baskets on your wall — a budget-friendly alternative to art that adds texture and depth.
---
###2. Organizing Baskets
Wicker bins and boxes bring a natural, collected feel to shelves and consoles while keeping clutter out of sight (hello, aesthetic storage!).
---
###3. Planters
Pop your plant babies into woven baskets to soften hard ceramic pots and bring in that earthy, organic vibe.
---
###4. Trays to Cluster Items
Use a wicker tray to corral your favorite candles, coasters, or curios on coffee tables or dressers — an easy styling win.
---
###5. Hiding Ugly Things
Cords, laundry, pet toys? Tuck them away in lidded baskets or deep bins for a cleaner look without sacrificing style.
---
###6. Unexpected Wicker Accents
Think beyond baskets — wicker lampshades, pet beds, or even a vintage side table can bring surprise and charm to any room.

Wicker is timeless, versatile, and always in style — how do you use it in your space?
