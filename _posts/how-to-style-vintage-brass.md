# How to Style Vintage Brass

Vintage brass is one of my favorite ways to add warmth and character to any room. It's timeless, a little bit glam, and totally versatile. Here are a few ways I like to style brass in my own space:

---

### 1. Layered Brass Candlesticks

Group mismatched candlesticks together on a mantle or sideboard. Look for different heights and patinas — the more worn, the better! I love pairing them with hand-dipped taper candles in moody tones like rust or forest green.

---

###  2. Brass Frames
Framing a photo or artwork in a brass picture frame immediately elevates it. I am able to find so many frames secondhand in a variety of sizes and they make a perfect edition to a gallery wall.

### 3. Brass + Botanicals

Brass and greenery are a match made in heaven. Try styling small brass planters with trailing vines, or use a brass tray to holding fern leaves, cut from the wild. The contrast of soft green with golden metal just works.

---

### 4. Shelf Styling with Brass Accents

Mix in small brass objects — animals, bowls, vases (the quirkier the better!) — alongside books and ceramics. They add a pop of shine and make your shelf look collected, not cluttered.

---

### Tip: Embrace the Imperfections

I love returning brass to the original state. Polished brass is beautiful, but so is the aged, slightly tarnished look. I rarely clean my pieces — a little patina tells a story.

✨ Whether you're a maximalist or minimalist, brass fits in beautifully. Start small, stay curious, and let your home evolve with the treasures you find.
